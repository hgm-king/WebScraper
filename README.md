# WebScraper

This is a side project I did for a local web developer I worked with in
Columbia, Missouri where I currently go to school. He had asked me to write
a program that would scan over all domain names throughout the internet,
take down various information regarding the usage of WordPress, note the admin
email address, and store all of the information into a database.

The script is meant to run using .csv files that can be taken from and DNS service that registers all domain names used on the internet. From there it will
process a set number(currently 50) domains at a time.
